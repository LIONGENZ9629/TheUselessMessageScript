# TheUselessMessageScript
A python script that gives you a useless message whenever you press enter. You can add your own messages by deleting the current ones or adding more with the message template.

Remember: When you go and put new messages in there, change the random.randint 45 number to the amount of elif's you have.

This was created in python 3 or if you want the exact version, it's 3.7.3.

Have fun!
